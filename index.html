            My Story📖
        </h1>
        <p>
            <em>Likely 7 years ago</em>, I was a young kid specifically a gamer. I was playing games like spiderman web of shadows and God of war 2, those were not enough for me, and I wanted to play something better something like GTA V, but my device wasn't able to run such games, so I looked forward to upgrading my device to support the games that I wished to play. I didn't know how I could afford this upgrade, how can I achieve this single innocent dream, one of my options was to ask my dad but asking my dad to upgrade our computer and get me a good graphics card to play games wasn't a good argument. I had to find another option; I searched innocently on YouTube "how to make money" but in Arabic and back then there wasn't much content about this topic especially in Arabic, so I didn't find something helpful that time. While playing my retro games I was wondering how these games were made are they are made of videos may be that changes between a video and another based on the keyboard 🤔and some other thoughts that may seem silly for a while, some curiosity made me go and learn how these games work and get into game dev. Suddenly, the computer stopped from working and when we fixed it, we made the upgrade that I wished and one of my dreams was suddenly achieved. But even after this I did still want more and more, also the games evolved more and more, then I realized that my dream isn't getting some games or a pc upgrade, my dream was to do whatever I want whenever I want with the least number of restrictions <strong>(Religion and Ethics)</strong> and to have a great effect on me and on the people around me. Also, my curiosity didn't pass away even after quitting game dev as it seemed to be irrelevant to me and quite hard and unrewarding in my point of view. These days I was hanging as a little script kiddie who's trying to make cool things on the computer 😅. Once I met a friend He's called Mostafa, Mostafa was an aspiring 3d artist he introduced me to that world. He was my mentor he is one of the most important factors of what I'm right now. He introduced me to money, banking, clients, and value. I learned about 3d models, it gave me a lot of experience about self-employment while dealing with clients and making mistakes and failures. I didn't land noticeable money at all. I did get scammed a lot which helped me later to avoid scams and learn how to get my rights whenever I get scammed or just have a right to request. After 3 years of getting into 3d, I've quit but with plenty of skills. I realized that I don't want to continue my life making 3d models even if it seemed nice and also after 3 years of experience it seemed that it wasn't my thing, and I've gave it enough time and effort but I'm happy that I've got into it because I've learned a lot, also this journey made me visible and suddenly googleable which is great but sometimes bad, at least for now it's going well. Although a good amount of influential people loved my work but 3D modeling wasn't contributing to my dreams. In this time, I used my knowledge about payments and finance to get paid. I didn't know that this was even possible, but it was rewarding even more than 3d in my case. For the first time I tasted some of the financial freedom, it was awesome times. I've tried working out with microservices also for a while, but I believe that it was a waste of time, I wasn't making real value or effect, I was just selling my time, so I decided not to do that again. One day, a client sent me a message that he wants to create a site for his company, and he'll pay 300 US Dollars. I did the job, and after this I shifted my entire career life. I learned that I was born to do something else, although 300 dollars is not a big deal for a website, but this is not the point. When I was kid, I dreamed of being a hacker same as a lot of kids. I was able to be something like a script kiddie because lack of sources these times, also I didn't learn "how to learn" but after going into 3d I did learn that. and with a fresh mindset I got into programming then into cybersecurity specifically bug hunting. I had to aquire some skills before getting into this, so I took Harvard’s CS50's introduction to programming with python certificate and reading black hat python book was also beneficial to introduce me to different libraries that can help me create my own custom tools. I learned about CCNA for the basics of networking. Also, I read a book named "Linux Basics for Hackers" which had a lot of useful information about Linux and a little taste of hacking, then I began reading a book named "Bug Bounty Bootcamp" aligned with Portswigger academy. During my journey I decided to learn fundamentals of backend dev to put myself in the shoes of a developer to learn how they think and how they fall into mistakes, and this was way helpful. Someday I had an idea for a web project that would also enhance my knowledge about how developers implement protection and how they fall in mistakes and how they are corrected and how can protections implemented by different technologies be misconfigure, also this project would fill a big gap and achieve a lot of people's dreams, yeah such a project is actually a dream although it might seem normal. The project was a web application for my school STEM Gharbiya. It might seem that this is not even a special idea, you are right actually. A website for the school a lot of people tried to do it, but no one were able to fully accomplish the project, but a system that integrates different aspects of the school that offers solutions to students and systemizes the student life at the school instead of randomness, this was a dream not a project due to insufficiency of backend developers in the school most of the time when a student at our school wants to get into web dev he chooses front end most of the time. So, both projects had severe challenges, and I knew that such an idea if it wasn't completed yet, so I'll face some serious challenges. My vision was making something special, big and unforgettable. I believed that I couldn’t do it alone, so I formed a team consisting of 4 developers at the beginning of the project. We’ve worked on this project for nearly a year right now. During this journey I learned a lot about security and several useful technologies, and I was introduced to APIs dev and hacking. Also, I knew why there isn't any official website for the school when I made a meeting with the school officials. Although they didn't mind the doing the idea and they loved the idea of the project, but they had a single simple problem that made the project seem almost impossible, they said, "We've no budget" then I said to them "No problem. We'll deal with it.". After what they've said depression spread between my team members which was expanded to 2 more devs and one of my devs wasn't powerful at dev so, I made her work at the spot of Public Relations which let her make way better performance. My team was depressed because of earlier trials that failed and older students who say that the school won't help such a project to be accomplished or won't adopt this site at their official one. one of the most famous trials was an unofficial site published on GitHub with GitHub free domain because the school didn't even have budget for a domain name, although the project was almost completed a static simple site that shows some details about the school. Our project had a more complex situation and seemed to be more impossible because a domain can be offered by any student as a small donation, but we needed an entire server not github pages to run our app because it wasn't static website, it was an app. I learned about a technology called cloudflare tunnelling which connects your app or service to the internet, so I wondered if the school could offer us a computer that runs the app, and it will be costless because the school has a lot of computers. This made me more confident, and I told the school principal that I got it, and I can solve the budgeting issue, the school cooperated with me and a teacher from the IT sector collaborated with me. That removed the depression and made the team feel that the project is possible and they should get back on track. But the school can't offer a computer for us 😅. I've found that the Hack club offers a server for students for free, so I tried it out and tried to deploy a demo, it wasn't that easy, but it worked. It made me learn about docker and nginx and integrate them with Cloudflared. Now one challenge that seemed impossible and even trying to reach out to sponsors was really depressing, one challenge remained which is the domain name. We could buy it ourselves, but I didn't want my team to pay for something that should reward them instead of taking money out of their pockets. One or two weeks ago, I was scrolling randomly on GitHub student pack maybe that I can find something to be beneficial to me not even for the site. I’ve found that GitHub offers a free domain for a year from Namecheap and name.com for students. It wasn't something new because they often require a payment method and in Egypt payment in foreign currency is forbidden due to economy issues. I've tried all my cards to register the domain and complete a payment of 0 dollars and suddenly it did work. Now, I'm closer than any time before <strong><a href="https://stemgharbiya.app" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">stemgharbiya.app</a></strong> is now coming soon and confidently I can say that it will be launched on 27th of September. What seemed impossible was just a challenge and now it became reality. My team expanded to 11 members and after launching we'll hire more admins to manage certain aspects of the app. I'd love to thank all of my team for their continuous efforts. During this journey I've learned a lot about security and deployment. I've solved 32 different labs on Portswigger from different topics ranging from XSS to CSRFs and Web Sockets security. Also, I've enrolled in a contest named EYCC and my team placed 6 out of more than 40 teams but sadly we weren't able to attend the onsite. I think that's enough about me, I could add more details, but this would make the story way longer.
